left,John Baldessari,"The United States, 1931–2020","John Baldessari was a conceptual artist known for his work in painting, printmaking and photography. He was a pivotal figure in the conceptual art movement, known for his use of image and text juxtapositions. Baldessari's work that resonates most with me is when he  combines photography and painting, because it blurs the boundaries between visual mediums, inviting viewers to question the conventions of art-making and the relationship between image and text. This fusion underscores his exploration of language, communication and the very essence of art. It challenges traditional modes of representation,  inviting a deeper contemplation of the interconnectedness of visual and linguistic forms.",/Images/BaldessariJohn/umbrella.png,,"Umbrella (Orange): With Figure and Ball (Blue, Green), 2004",,,,
left,Henri Cartier-Bresson,"France, 1908–2004","Henri Cartier-Bresson was a renowned French photographer widely regarded as one of the pioneers of photojournalism and street photography. I particularly enjoy his spontaneous approach to capturing moments of everyday life, which often portray a  decisive moment. This technique leaves the viewer on a cliffhanger, wanting to find out more. His photographs serve as windows into the soul of humanity, capturing fleeting moments of beauty, joy and introspection that resonate deeply with my own experiences and emotions.",/Images/Cartier-BressonHenri/bankofficer.png,,"Bank officer and his secretary, 1960",,,,

She gained prominence as part of the Young British Artists (YBAs) movement in the 1990s and  became particularly well-known for her candid and confessional artworks, which often explore themes of sexuality, identity, trauma and vulnerability. Tracey Emin's art resonates with me due to its deeply personal nature. It offers a unique opportunity to forge an intimate connection with the artist, providing an authentic glimpse into her life and experiences.",/Images/EminTracey/MyBed1998.png,,"My Bed, 1998",,,,
left,Tony Garifalakis,"Australia, 1964–","Tony Garifalakis is an artist known for his provocative and thought-provoking work which explores themes of identity, power and societal norms. Garifalakis employs a variety of mediums including painting, sculpture, and collage to create visually arresting artworks that challenge viewers' perceptions and assumptions. His work is interesting to me because he incorporates the idea of a mask as a central motif, symbolising the layers of identity we construct and how we present ourselves to the world. By obscuring faces and altering found images, Garifalakis prompts viewers to question the authenticity of the self and the societal pressures to conform to certain norms.

Ren Hang was a photographer known for his provocative and highly expressive nude portraits. He gained international recognition for his work, which often pushed the boundaries of traditional Chinese cultural norms and censorship laws. I first came across his work in my CATS class and was immediately drawn to his surrealist compositions and intimate portrayals of the human body, exploring  themes of sexuality and identity. His fearless approach to challenging societal taboos and his ability to capture raw emotions in his subjects is an aspect of his work that I deeply respect.",/Images/HangRen/Untitled2015.jpg,,"Untitled, 2015",,,,

left,Martin Parr,"The United Kingdom, 1952–","Martin Parr is a  documentary photographer, known for his unique and often satirical approach to capturing everyday life and societal norms. Parr's work  touches on themes such as consumerism, tourism, and social class in contemporary society. Looking at his photographs, it often seems that Parr is not part of the world that he is photographing but rather a bystander. This is an idea I want to touch on in future projects by exploring  what my role is in society and how I can contribute to it.",/Images/ParrMartin/OrdinaryPeople.jpg,,"New Brighton, 1985",,,,

He co-founded the design collective Tomato in 1991, which gained international recognition for its  work in graphic design, multimedia and art. John's work interests me particularly for its use of typography which goes beyond mere aesthetics, serving as a means of expression, inviting viewers to engage with the words on multiple levels. I also appreciate both his use of analogue techniques to craft the final artifact and his keen observation of the surrounding world for inspiration, drawing from elements such as light and shadow.",/Images/WarwickerJohn/dubnobasswithmyheadman.png,,"
